# Work_Projects
This respository is dedicated to some of my python code that I've created in work.
You can find some code that modifies xml files to a format acceptable for upload into systems and finds certain information in these xml files.
There are also some code that automates daily tasks thanks to selenium package and webscraping.

Some of the code has been changed due to compliance reasons.
